# eqsam

EQSAM (EQuilibrium Simplified Aerosol Model) is a computationally efficient thermodynamic<br />
aerosol composition model that allows to calculate the gas/aerosol equilibrium partitioning,<br />
including aerosol water, sufficiently fast and accurate for global and regional modeling.<br />
EQSAM is based on a number of parameterizations, including single solute molalities and activity<br />
coefficients. The thermodynamic framework (domains and subdomains, internally mixed aerosols)<br />
is the same as of more complex aerosol thermodynamic equilibrium models, e.g. of ISORROPIA<br />
(Nenes et al., 1998). Details are given in the references below (and the references therein).<br />
